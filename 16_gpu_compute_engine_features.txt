# Compute Engines Features:GPUs
->How do you accelerate math intensive and graphics-intensive workloads for AI/ML etc?
-> Add a GPU to your virtual machine:
 .High performance for math intensive and graphics-intensive workloads
 .High cost
 .(Remember) Use images with GPU libraries (Deep learning) installed
 ->GPU restrictions:
 .Not supported on all machine types(For example,not supported on shared-core or memory-optimized machine types)
 .On host maintenance can only have the value"Terminate VM instance"
 ->Recommended Availability policy for GPUs

 # Virtual Machine-Remember
  ->Associated with a project
  ->Machine type availability can vary from region to regions
  ->You can only change the machine type (adjust the number of vCPUs and memory) of a stopped instance
   ->You cannot change the machine type of a running instance
  ->VM's can be filtered by various properties
    -> Name,Zone,Machine,Type,Internal/External IP,Network,Labels etc
   ->Instances are Zonal (Run in a specific zone(in a specific region))
  ->Images are global(you can provide to other projects-if needed)
  ->Instance templates are global(Unless you use zonal resources in your templates)
  ->Automatic Basic Monitoring is enabled
  ->Default Metrics:CPU utilization,Network Bytes (in/out),Disk throughput/IOPS
  ->For Memory Utilization & Disk Space Utilization-Cloud Monitoring agent is needed
