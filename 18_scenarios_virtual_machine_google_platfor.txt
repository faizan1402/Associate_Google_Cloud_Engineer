# Compute Engine Scenarios

->Scenario                                              solution



1-What are the pre-requisites to be able                   1 Project
to create a VM instance                                  2 Biling Account
                                                         3 Compute Engine API should be enabled

2-You want to dedicate for hardware for your                     Sole tenant notes 
compliance licensing and management need  

3-I have 1000 VMs and I want to automatic OS                      Use VM manager
path management,OS inventory management and
OS configuration management(manage software installed)

4-You want to login to your VM instance to install                 You can SSH into it
software

5-You do not want to expose VM internet                             Do not assign an External IP address


6-You want to allow HTTP traffic to your VM                         Configure Firewall rules


# Quick Review :

 # Image:
  -> What operating system and what software do you want on the VM instance?

  -> Reduce boot time and improve security by creating custome handended images.

  ->You can share an image with other projects
   #Machine Types:
  ->Optimized combination of compute(CPU,GPU),memory,networking for specific workloads.

  -> You can create your own Custom Machine Types when existing ones don't fit your needs.

 ->  Static IP Addresses: Get a constant IP addressed for VM instances 
 ->  Instace Templates:Pre-configured templates simplifying the creation of VM  instances
 ->  use discounts: Automatic discounts for running significant portion of the billing month
 -> Committed use discounts:1 year of 3 year reservations for workload with predictable resource needs.
 ->Preemptible VM: Short-lived cheaper(upto 80%) compute instances for non-time-criticl fault-tolerant workloads
