 Pass Through: Directly send the requrest to the backend side

# Cloud Load Balancing - Features :

    Load Balancer        Type of Traffic          Proxy or Pass Through        Destination Ports

1-> External HTTPS      Global,External,HTTP,      Proxy                        HTTP on 80 or 8080

# Load Balancer Scenarios :

Scenario :                                                      Solution:

1) You want only healthy instances to                           Configure health check
recieve traffic.

2)You want high availability for your VM                       Create multiple MIG for instance.                                                      your VM instances in mu
                                                               ltiple regions load balance using load balancer.        

3) You want to route requests to multiple                      Create a individual MIGs and backe 
microservices using the same load balancer.                    nds  for each microservice.create H
                                                               Host and path rules to  redirect to specific microservice backend based on the path (/microservice-a,/microservice-b etc.) you can route a backend cloud storage bucket as well.


4)You want to load balance Global external                     Choose external                    
 HTTPS traffic across backend instances,                       HTTPs load balancer
 across multiple regions.

 5) You want to SSL termination for Global                     Choose SSL proxy load balancer
 non HTTPs traffic with load balancing




# 
1)Create Multiple MIGs for yourVM 
      instances in
2)  multiple request balance using a Load Balaner.
3) Create individual MIGs and backends for each microservice.create Host and path rules to redirect to specific microservice backend based on the path (/microservice-a,/microservice-b etc.)
you can route a backend cloud storage bucket as well.
