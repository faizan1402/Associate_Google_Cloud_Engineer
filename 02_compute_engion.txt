# Google Compute Engine (GCE)
  -> In corporate data centers,application are deployed to physical servers
  -> Where do you deploy applications in the cloud?
   . Rent virtual servers
   . Virtual Machines - Virtual serverse in GCP
  -> Google Compute Engine (GCE)-Provision & Manage Virtual Machines
  -> Create and manage lifecycle of virtual machine (VM) instances
  -> Load balancing and auto scalling for your VM instances
 # Our Goal:
     -> Setup VM instances as HTTP(Web) server
     -> Distribute load with Load Balancers

# Compute Engine Hands-on
  -> Let's create a few VM instances and play with them
  -> Let's check out the lifecycle of VM instances
  -> Let's use SSH to connect to VM instancess
