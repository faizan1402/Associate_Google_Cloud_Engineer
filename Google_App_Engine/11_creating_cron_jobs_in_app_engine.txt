 # App Engine-Remember

 -> AppEngine is Regional(services deployed across zones)
   .You cannot change an Applications region
 -> Good option for simple microservices(multiple services)
   .Use standard v2 when you are using supported languages
   .Use Flexible if you are building containerized apps
 -> Be aware-Atleast one container always running when using Flexible:
    .Go for standard if you want to be able to scale down the number of instances to zero when there is No load.
 -> Use a combination of resident and dynamic instances
   .Resident Instances:Run continuously
   .Dynamic Instances:Added based on load
     .Use all dynamic instances if you are cost sensitive.
     .If you are not very cost sensitive,keep a set of resident instances running always
