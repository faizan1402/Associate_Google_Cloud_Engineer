# App Engine -Scaling Instances
->Automatic:Automatically scale instances based on the load:
 .Recommended for continously running workloads
 . Auto scale based on:
  . Target CPU Utilization-Configure a CPU threshold.
  . Target Throughput Utilization- Configure a throughput threshold
  .Max Concurrent Requests-Configure max concurrent requests an instance can recieve.
  .Configure Max Instances and Min Instances.
 ->Basic:Instances are created as and when requests are recieved:
  . Recommended for Adhoc Workloads
   .Instances are shutdown if zero requests
    .Tries to keep costs low
    .High latency is possible
   .Not supported by App Engine Flexible Environment
   .Configure Max Instances and Idle Timeout
 ->Manual: Configure specific number of instances to run:
  .Adjust number of instances manually over time.
