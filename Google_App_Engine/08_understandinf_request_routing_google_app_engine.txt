# AppEngine - Request Routing
#You can use a combination of three approaches:
# Routing with urls:
-> https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.rappspot.com (default service called)
-> https://SERVICE-dot-PROJECT_ID.rappspot.com (specific service)
->https://VERSION-dot-SERVICE-dot-PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.rappspot.com(specific version of service)
-> Replace -dot-with.if using custom domain

# Routing with a dispatch file:
 ->Configure dispatch.yaml with routes
 -> gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml
 # Routing with Cloud Load Balancing:
 ->Configure routes on Load Balancing instance
