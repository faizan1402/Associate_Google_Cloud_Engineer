# App Engine-Deploying new versions without downtime
# How do I go from V1 to V2 without downtime?
#Option 1:I'm very confident-deploy & shift all traffic at once:
 ->Deploy and shift all traffic at once from v1 to v2:gcloud app deploy
#Option 2:I want to manage the migration from v1 to v2
 -> Step 1: Deploy v2 without shifting traffic (--no-promote)
  . gcloud app deploy--no-promote
 -> Step 2: Shift traffic to V2:
  .Option 1 (All at once Migration): Migrate all at once to v2
   .gcloud app services set traffic s1 --splitsV2=1
  .Option 2:(Gradual Migration):Gradually shift traffic to v2.Add --migrate option.
    .Gradual migration is not supported by App Engine Flexibile Environment
  .Option 3 (Spliting):Control the pace of migration
    .gcloud app services set-traffic s1 --splits=v2=.5,v1=.5
    . Useful to perform A/B testing.
