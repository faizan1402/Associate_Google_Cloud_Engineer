# Cloud Load Balancing
-> Distributes user traffic across instances of an application in single or multiple regions

  -> Fully distributed,software defined managed service

  -> Important Features:
    . Health check - Route to healthy instances
     . Recover from failures
    . Auto Scaling
    . Global load balancing with single anycast IP
     . Also supports internal load balancing
   -> Enables:
      . High Availability
      . Auto Scaling
      . Resiliency
   # HTTP vs HTTPS vs TCP vs TLS vs UDP

  Application Layer(Layer 7)     HTTP HTTP SMTP
  Transport Layer(Layer 4)       TCL,TLS,UDP
  Network Layer(Layer 3)          IP

 # Network Layer:
  ->IP(Internet Protocol):Transfer bytes.Unreliable
  # Transport Layer:
   .TCP (Transmission Control):Reliability>Performance
   . TLS(Transport Layer Security):Secure TCP
   . UDP(User Datagram Protocol): Performance > Reliability
   ->Application Layer :
    . HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol):Stateless Request Response Cycle
    . HTTPS:Secure HTTP
    . SMTP:Email Transfer Protocol

   -> Most applications typically communicate at application layer
     .Web apps/REST API(HTTPS),Email Servers(SMTP),File Transfers(FTP)
     .All these applications use TCP/TLS at network layer(for reliability)
  -> However applications needing high performance directly communicate at transport layer:




  -> Computers use protocols to communicate
  -> Mutiple layers and multiple protocols

  # Network Layer : Transfer bits and bytes
  # Transport Layer : Are the bits and bytes transferred property?
  # Application Layer : Make REST API calls and Send Emails
  -> (Remember) Each layer makes use of the layers beneath it

  -> (Remember) Most application talk at application layer some applications talk at network layer directly(high perfomance).
