#   Instance Groups
 -> How do you create a group of VM instances?
    .Instance Group-Group of VM instances managed as a single entity
     .Manage group of similar VMS having similar lifecycle as ONE UNIT
   -> Two Types of Instance Groups:
     -> Managed:Identical VMS created using a template:
     . Features:Auto scaling,auto healing and managed relates
     -> Unmanaged:Different configuration for VMS in same group:
     . Does not offer auto scaling,auto healing & other services
     . Not Recommended unless you need differnt kinds of VMs
     . Location can be Zonal or Regional

   # Managed Instance Groups (MIG)

    . Managed Instance Group - Identical VMs created using instance template

    -> Important Features of Managed Instance:
     .Maintain certain numbers of instances
      . If an instance crashes,MIG launches another instance
     . Detect application failues using health checks (self healing)
     . Increase and decrease instances based on load (Auto Scaling)
     . Add Load Balancer to distribute load
     . Create instances in multiple zones (regional MIGs)
     . Regional MIGs provide higher availablity compared to zonal MIGs
     . Release new application versions without downtime
      . Rolling updates: Release new version step by step (gradually).Update a percentage of instances to the new version at a time.
      . Canary Deployment : Test new version with a group of instances before releasing it across all instances.

  # Creating Managed Instance Group (MIG)
    -> Instance template is manadatory
    -> Configure auto-scaling to automatically adjust number of instances based on load:
     -> Minimum number of instances
     -> Maximum number of instances
     -> Autoscaling metrics:CPU Utilization target or Load Balancer Utilization target or Any other metric from Stack Driver
  .Cool-down period: Prevent a sudden drop in no of VM instances
  . Scale in Controls: Prevent a sudden drop in no of VM instances
  . Example : Do n't scale in by more than 10% or 3 instances in 5 minutes

  -> Autohealing:Configure a health check with initial delay (How long should you wait for your app to initialize before running a health chec?)
