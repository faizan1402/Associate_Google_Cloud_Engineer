# Managed Services
-> Do you want to continue running applications in the cloud,the same way you run them in your data center?
->OR are there Other approaches?
-> You should understand some terminology used with cloud services:
-> LaaS(Infrastructure as a Service)
-> PaaS(Platform as a Service)
-> CaaS(Container as a Service)
-> Serverless

# IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service)
-> Use only infrastructure from cloud provider
-> Example:Using VM to deploy your applications or databases
# You are responsible for:
->Application Code and Runtime
-> Configuring load balancing
-> Auto scaling
-> OS upgrades and patches
-> Availability
-> etc ...(and a lot of things!)

# PAAS(Plateform as a Service)
-> Use a platform provided by cloud
-> Cloud provider is responsible for:
  . OS(incl.upgrades and patches)
  . Application Runtime
  . Auto scaling,Availability & Load balancing etc.
-> You are responsible for:
  .Configuration(of Application and Services)
  . Application code(if needed)
-> Varieties:
  . CAAS(Container As A Service):Container instead of Apps
  . FAAS(Function As A Service):Function instead of Apps
  . Databases- Relational & NoSQL(Amazon,RDS,Google Cloud,SQL,Azure SQL,Database etc),Queue,AI,ML,Operation etc!
