  #Introduction google associate cloud engineer
# Cloud - Advantages :
-> Trade "capital expense" for "variable expense"
-> Benifit from massive economies of scale
-> Stop guessing capacity
-> Stop spending money running maintaining data centers
-> Go globl in minutes

 Google Cloud  Platform (GCP)
# One of the top3 cloud service providers
# Provides a number of services (200+) (GCP)
-# Reliable,secure and highly-performant:
    -> Infrastructure that powers 8 services with over 1 Bilion Gmail,Google Search,Youtube etc.
-# One thing I love : "cleanest cloud"
    -> Net carbon-neutral cloud (electricity used matched 100% with renewable energy)
# The entire course is all about GCP.You will learn it as we go further.

# Cloud applications make use of multiple GCP services
# There is no single path to learn these services independently

# HOWEVER,we've worked out a simple path!

 # Regions And Zones :
 
-> Imagine that your application is deployed in a data center in London
-> What would be the challenges?
   .Challenge 1 : Slow access for users from other parts of the world (high latency)
   
# Multiple data centers
   -> London Region 
      . Corporate data center1 Coporate data Center2
# What would be the challenges?
      . Challenge1: Slow access for users from other parts of the world
      . Challenge2 (Solved):What if one data center crashes?
      . Challenge3 (Solved): What if entire region of London is unavailable?
   
   # Regions :
  -> Imagine setting up data centers in different regions around the world
  -> Different regions around the world 
     . Would that be easy?
  -> (Solution) Google provides 20+ regions around the world
   -> Expanding every year
    # Region : Specific geographical location to host your resources
 

# Advantages:
   -> High Availability
   -> Low Latency
   -> Global Footprint

  Zones : How to achieve high availability in the same region (or geographic location)?
 
  -> Each region has three or more zones
  -> (Advantage) Increased availability and fault tolerance within same region
  -> (Remember) Each zone has one or more discreate clusters
     > Cluster : distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data center
  -> (Remember) Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links
  
   New Regions and Zones are constantly added :
