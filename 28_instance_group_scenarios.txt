# Instance Group Scenarios
  
  Scenario                                             Solution

 1) You wan to MIG managed                            Create multiple zone                       
    application to survive                            (MIG) or (regional zone)
    Zonal Failures                                    

  2) Yo want to create VMs of                         Create Unmanaged Instance Group
     a different configuration
     of the same group

  3) You want to preserve                            StateFul MIG: Preserve VM state(instance
     VM state in an MIG                               Name,attached Persitent disks and Meta
                                                      data.)Recommanded for stateful Workloads
                                                      database,data processing apps

  
  4) You want to high availability                   Use an instance template availabilty 
     an MIG even when there are                         policy automatic restart:enabled & host
     hardware/software updates                          menatainance:migrate Ensure live
                                                      migration and automatic restarts.

 
 5) you want unhealthy instances                      Configure check on the MIG (self healing)
 to be replaced by automatic                           

 6) Avoid Frequent scale up and downs                  Cool/down period initial delay
