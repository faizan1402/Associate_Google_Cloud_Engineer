# Reducing Launch Time with Custom Image
 ->Installing OS patches and software at launch of VM instances increase boot up time
 ->How about creating a custom image with OS patches and software pre-installed?
 -> Can be created from an instance,a persistent disk a snapshot,another image,or file in cloud storage
 ->can be shared across projects
 -> (Recommendation) Desprecate old images (& specify replacement image)
 ->(Recommendation) hardening an image- customize images to your corporate security standards.
 -> Prefer using Custom Image to Startup script

 -> Instance-1 (Compute Engine) -> Image(Compute Engine) -> Instances (Compute Engine)

 # How to create custom image
   -> open disks (this disks is virtual machine disks)

   ->after that custom images load then instance template file copy and chage the image file (copy instancetemplate and changes the custom-image add the file)
   -> my-instance-template-with-custom-image 
   -> after create vm(virtual machine)
   -> and previous activity are deleted (means vm instance of instance template in vm)
   ->Hello world from my-instance-template-with-custom-image-1 10.182.0.5 (output is showing before image are created) ( 10.182.0.5 this is internal ip address)
